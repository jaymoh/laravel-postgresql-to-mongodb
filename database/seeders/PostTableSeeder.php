Along the way, you'll see how to remodel your data from tables into documents, and how this change affects querying, relationships, and performance. Additionally, we'll explore how MongoDB Atlas can double as both your database and your search engineâ€”cutting out the need for third-party tools like ElasticSearch, to handle full-text search needs.",
