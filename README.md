# Laravel Postgres to MongoDB Migration

This repo demonstrates how easy it is to migrate a Laravel application from a relational database (Postgres) to MongoDB.

The main branch of this repository contains a sample Laravel application that uses Postgres as its database, and ElasticSearch for full text search.

The `mongodb` branch contains the same application, but it has been modified to use MongoDB Atlas as its database and Atlas Search for full text search.

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Postgres
- MongoDB
- Laravel 12.x
- Laravel MongoDB package (jenssegers/mongodb)
- Laravel UI package (laravel/ui)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend scaffolding)
- Git
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, PHPStorm)
- Basic knowledge of Laravel, Postgres, and MongoDB
- Docker (for simplified setup)
- (Optional) For manual setup, install [PostgreSQL Server](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) locally.
- MongoDB Server can be installed locally, or you can use the MongoDB cloud service [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).

### Installation and Setup

**_(TODO: And the tutorial link here when it's ready)_**

#### Quick Setup with Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can get up and running quickly.

We have included a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify the setup process. For the main branch, it sets up a Postgres
Database, ElasticSearch container, a Laravel Queue Worker, and runs the laravel scout command to index the posts in elastic search, so you can test the app before we migrate to MongoDB.

The `mongodb` branch, has its own `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up the application and a laravel queue worker. We are using MongoDB Atlas for the database in this branch, so no need of a container for MongoDB. You will however need to set up a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas and update the `.env` file with your connection string.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:jaymoh/laravel-postgresql-to-mongodb.git
    cd laravel-postgresql-to-mongodb
    ```
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
   The above command will build and start the application, Postgres database, and other necessary services in detached mode.
   The --build flag ensures that Docker images are rebuilt, which is necessary when switching between branches or when dependencies have changed.
   The `Dockerfile.app` will handle the installation of PHP dependencies, run and build frontend assets, set up the application, and run migrations and seeders.
   The `Dockerfile.queue` will set up a Laravel queue worker to handle any queued jobs.

4. Run the following command to import posts and users into ElasticSearch (main branch only):
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app php artisan scout:queue-import "App\Models\Post"
   docker compose exec app php artisan scout:queue-import "App\Models\User"
   ```
   This command will index all existing posts into ElasticSearch for full text search functionality.

5. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

6. You can log in with the following credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`

7. To stop the application and remove containers, networks, and volumes, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ```

#### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up without Docker:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jaymoh/laravel-postgresql-to-mongodb.git
   cd laravel-postgresql-to-mongodb
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
    ```
4. Configure database connection in .env:
    - For Postgres (main branch):
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=laravel
   DB_USERNAME=laravel
   DB_PASSWORD=secret
    ```
    - For MongoDB (mongodb branch):
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mongodb
    DB_HOST=
    DB_PORT=27017
    DB_DATABASE=laravel
    DB_USERNAME=
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```
5. Run migrations and seed the database:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```
6. Batch import posts into ElasticSearch (main branch only):
   ```bash
   php artisan scout:import "App\Models\Post"
   ```
7. Install and build frontend assets:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Serve the application:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
     ```
9. Access the application:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Switching Between Postgres and MongoDB Versions

To switch between database versions:

1. Checkout the desired branch:
   - For Postgres:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
   - For MongoDB:
     ```bash
     git checkout mongodb
     ```
2. Follow the setup instructions for the chosen branch. Remember to:
    - Stop and remove existing containers: docker compose down -v 
    - Rebuild and start containers: docker compose up -d --build 
    - If you are following the manual process, run composer install after switching branches as dependencies may differ. 
    - Update your .env file with appropriate database settings. 
    - Clear configuration cache with php artisan config:clear 
    - Run migrations again if needed (postgres main branch): php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

### Application Features
A simple app ( users, blog posts, comments), full text search.
- It allows us to demonstrate CRUD operations and relationships in both Postgres and MongoDB.
